🌟 Empowering Wine Quality Predictions with Machine Learning 🌟
I’m thrilled to share my latest project during my internship at Oasis Infobyte, where I developed a Random Forest Classifier model to predict wine quality based on its chemical properties. 🍷📊
## 🔍 Key Highlights of the Project:
## insight 
Transformed the dataset into a binary classification problem to identify "Good Quality" and "Bad Quality" wines.
Achieved high accuracy using the Random Forest Classifier, showcasing the power of ensemble learning techniques.
Analyzed features such as acidity, pH levels, sulphates, and alcohol to determine their impact on wine quality.
Provided actionable insights for winemakers to improve product quality through data-driven decisions.# Data-Analytics-with-Oasis-Infobyte-wine-prediction-
The focus is on predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics, offering a real-world application of machine learning in the context of viticulture.
